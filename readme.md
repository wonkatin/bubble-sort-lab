# Bubble Sort

## Introduction

Bubble Sort is a simple sort, if not a particularly efficient one, and thus makes a great starting point for our sorting journey.

The function `bubble_sort` has been started for you in `bubble_sort.py`, along with an example test case. That is the only file you'll need to touch for this lab.

## Algorithm Outline

- In the outer loop, run the inner loop once for EACH number in your list. (Since you'll have to perform one pass of the whole list for each element in the list.)
- In the inner loop, you will run each actual pass, performing the following steps:
  1. Compare each number to the next.
  2. Check if they're in the wrong order.
  3. If they are... swap them!

## Hints

- It's a good idea to save the length of your list into a variable for easy access.
- `range` is really useful in your `for` loops.
- Getting the error `IndexError: list index out of range`? You probably compared the last number with the one after--there is nothing after the last number! (That's what "last" means...)
- In Python, you can swap two values with the following sweet sweet syntax:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
x, y = y, x
print(x) # --> 10
print(y) # --> 5

someList = [1, 2, 3]
someList[0], someList[2] = someList[2], someList[0]
print(someList) # --> [3, 2, 1]
```

## Stretch Goals

### Implement Bubble Sort In JavaScript

It's a bit more verbose, but has some actual added challenge, thanks to not having Python's shortcut for swapping values.

### Implement Selection Sort

Similar structure to Bubble Sort (still requires a nested loop, so O(n^2) time), but with less actual swapping necessary; just once per outer loop!

Each time through the inner loop, you'll find the smallest number, and then move it all the way to the left. An example:

Say you've got a list of `[3, 7, 6, 1, 2]`.

The first pass through the loop, you find the smallest number and swap it with the first element. So the `1` would swap with the `3`, giving you:

`[1, 7, 6, 3, 2]`

Next, you move to the next index (index `1`, where the `7` is located) and perform the same operation, swapping the smallest number to the right with the current index. So the `2` would swap places with the `7`, giving you:

`[1, 2, 6, 3, 7]`

Selection Sort is different enough from Bubble Sort that implementing it is going to require you to get the flow of logic of _both_. Good luck!
